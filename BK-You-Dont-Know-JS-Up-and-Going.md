* The JavaScript engine actually compiles the program on the fly and then immediately runs the compiled code.
* Object property access
  * `obj.a`
  * `obj["a"]`
* Equality
  * == (loose-equals)
  * === (strict-equals)
* if you use the `==` loose-equals operator to make the comparison "99.99" == 99.99, JavaScript will convert the left-hand side "99.99" to its number equivalent 99.99. The comparison then becomes 99.99 == 99.99, which is of course true
