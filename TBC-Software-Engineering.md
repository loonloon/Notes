<a href='https://insights.dice.com/2016/07/13/tips-passing-pair-programming-test/'>Tips for Passing a Pair-Programming Test</a>
* Ask About the Test Structure and Setup
  * Applicants should <strong>ask how long the test should last</strong>
  * Though you’ll probably be able to look up syntax, documentation and APIs during the test, it’s a good idea to <strong>ask permission first</strong>
  * If there’s time, <strong>set up your test first</strong> so you can run, test and debug the code to make sure everything works as it should
* Focus on Solving the Problem
  * The interviewer is primarily looking for two things:
    * Your ability to solve the problem
    * Your ability to collaborate, communicate and work with a partner in a pairing environment
  * Always walk your partner through your decision-making process and likely approach before you tackle a problem
    * If you know a novel way to solve a problem, suggest it
    * But keep in mind that results trump flash in a testing situation, so it’s in your best interest to stick with the straightforward, slam-dunk solution
  * Break down bigger problems into small, manageable chunks so you can test and change your code (if necessary) as you go
  * Think about edge cases
    * Search for edge-case bugs by running your code against a variety of inputs

* Be prepared
  * As an interviewer
    * look through your candidate’s CV, résumé, or source code if they have submitted it. This will help you set your own expectations for their skill level and personality, which will help when communicating with them. Knowing that you have the same hobbies could be a good ice breaker!

  * As an interviewee
    * <strong>go to the company’s website and read / click through</strong>. I have been in a situation where I applied as a web developer, and the first question thrown at me was, “So, have you seen our website? What do you think can you do to improve it?” Suffice it to say, I botched that interview. So please, at the very least, have a look at their website. Review your code if you submitted it and double check everything.

* Relax and be yourself

* Ask questions!
  * As an interviewer
    * be aware that most of the time the candidate will be nervous. While asking too many questions can potentially scare them away, not asking any questions puts you in the dark and wastes your day of pairing.
    * I've learned to list down a set of questions that I get to ask during the day of pairing. The list does not have to be in order, and you do not have to ask them all in one go. Most of the questions will come up while you are pairing, but it's best to have them written down just in case.
  * As an interviewee
    * remember that some interviewers <strong>EXPECT you to ask questions</strong>. Not asking means you are not interested (why are you applying anyway?) or you know everything (which you don't).
    * Whenever I pair with someone, I take note of when they ask a question and how often. Questions can range from simple syntax questions like "What was the first argument for each_with_index again?" to work-related questions like "Do you usually pair every day?"

* There are no right or wrong solutions
  * As an interviewer
    * don't be stuck to the notion of your own solution to a problem. There are 11287398173 ways to write FizzBuzz and your solution is (probably) not the best one there is. Instead, be more open to other solutions and judge them as best you can.
    * When I do pairing interviews, I usually have an answer in mind when I ask a question, but I listen and see what the interviewee’s answer is, because it is almost never the same answer as mine. You’ll be surprised at how creative people can get!
  * As an interviewee
    * be aware of this fact and just do your thing. Don’t get stuck worrying that you won't be efficient (unless that was the interview question!) but at the same time, don’t be sloppy. <strong>If you come in to a pairing session for a company that does TDD/BDD, for your sake, start with tests first!</strong> They will be looking for that (I do!) and you could end up at the bottom of the pile if you just smash things out.
 
 * Treat this as a normal pairing day
   * As an interviewer
     * let your candidate drive 90% of the time — but never 100%. That gives off the impression that it is a stricter tech interview (you’re just beside them looking at their every move — which actually makes concentrating harder). Have a go with the keyboard a bit and let them talk you through their solution. This will put them at ease.
   * As an interviewee
     * <strong>don't just start typing the moment the keyboard is given to you. Start discussing your solution first.</strong> Ask your partner if they want to have the keyboard while you let them know your thoughts. Remind yourself that this is more of a pairing "test drive" instead of a tech interview. Which brings me to the next point...
     
* Talk to your partner
  * As an interviewer
    * it is important to keep the conversation going to let the candidate feel that it is a pairing session. At this point in time, you two are a single unit. You should both be able to communicate well with each other and bounce ideas back and forth.
    * Of course, there will be times your candidate will need to think by themselves, so let them have that as well. Find the balance between keeping up the conversation and letting them focus and solve the problem.
  * As an interviewee
    * <strong>always let your partner know what you plan to do and what your solution is.</strong> This lets them know that you recognize the fact that this is a pairing session and that you can communicate your ideas well. This also gives them the feeling that you plan things carefully, instead of going YOLO.

* It's okay to take a moment to think
  * As an interviewer
    * you will rarely have to do this. But if you are in my situation, where you are pairing with a candidate on a feature you’re actually implementing, then you too will need time to think. Just let your partner know about this and it should be fine.
  * As an interviewee
    * <strong>you can let your partner know that you will need a bit of time to think and that you will let them know your solution after.</strong> This shows that you are acknowledging their presence and that you will be communicating your thoughts after you process them. Communication is key!

#### Continuous Integration ####
Continuous integration (CI) is the practice of merging all developer working copies to a shared mainline several times a day.

#### Continuous Delivery ####
* Continuous delivery (CD or CDE) is a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time and, when releasing the software, doing so manually.
* It aims at building, testing, and releasing software with greater speed and frequency. 
* The approach helps reduce the cost, time, and risk of delivering changes by allowing for more incremental updates to applications in production. 
* A straightforward and repeatable deployment process is important for continuous delivery.

#### Continuous Deployment ####
Continuous deployment (CD) is a software engineering approach in which software functionalities are delivered frequently through automated deployments.
