* Ask About the Test Structure and Setup
  * Applicants should ask how long the test should last
  * Though you’ll probably be able to look up syntax, documentation and APIs during the test, it’s a good idea to ask permission first
  * If there’s time, set up your test first so you can run, test and debug the code to make sure everything works as it should
* Focus on Solving the Problem
  * The interviewer is primarily looking for two things:
    * Your ability to solve the problem
    * Your ability to collaborate, communicate and work with a partner in a pairing environment
  * Always walk your partner through your decision-making process and likely approach before you tackle a problem
    * If you know a novel way to solve a problem, suggest it
    * But keep in mind that results trump flash in a testing situation, so it’s in your best interest to stick with the straightforward, slam-dunk solution
  * Break down bigger problems into small, manageable chunks so you can test and change your code (if necessary) as you go
  * Think about edge cases
    * Search for edge-case bugs by running your code against a variety of inputs

* Be prepared

#### Continuous Integration ####
Continuous integration (CI) is the practice of merging all developer working copies to a shared mainline several times a day.

#### Continuous Delivery ####
* Continuous delivery (CD or CDE) is a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time and, when releasing the software, doing so manually.
* It aims at building, testing, and releasing software with greater speed and frequency. 
* The approach helps reduce the cost, time, and risk of delivering changes by allowing for more incremental updates to applications in production. 
* A straightforward and repeatable deployment process is important for continuous delivery.

#### Continuous Deployment ####
Continuous deployment (CD) is a software engineering approach in which software functionalities are delivered frequently through automated deployments.
