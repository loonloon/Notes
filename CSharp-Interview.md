#### What is Yield? ####
```
public class ContactListStore : IStore<ContactModel>
{
    public IEnumerable<ContactModel> GetEnumerator()
    {
        var contacts = new List<ContactModel>();

        Console.WriteLine("ContactListStore: Creating contact 1");
        contacts.Add(new ContactModel { FirstName = "Bob", LastName = "Blue" });

        Console.WriteLine("ContactListStore: Creating contact 2");
        contacts.Add(new ContactModel { FirstName = "Jim", LastName = "Green" });

        Console.WriteLine("ContactListStore: Creating contact 3");
        contacts.Add(new ContactModel { FirstName = "Susan", LastName = "Orange" });

        return contacts;
    }
}

static void Main(string[] args)
{
    var store = new ContactListStore();
    var contacts = store.GetEnumerator();

    Console.WriteLine("Ready to iterate through the collection.");
    Console.ReadLine();
}

Console Output 
ContactListStore: Creating contact 1 
ContactListStore: Creating contact 2 
ContactListStore: Creating contact 3 
Ready to iterate through the collection.

Note: The entire collection was loaded into memory without even asking for a single item in the list
```

```
public class ContactYieldStore : IStore<ContactModel>
{
    public IEnumerable<ContactModel> GetEnumerator()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("ContactYieldStore: Creating contact 1");
        yield return new ContactModel { FirstName = "Bob", LastName = "Blue" };

        Console.WriteLine("ContactYieldStore: Creating contact 2");
        yield return new ContactModel { FirstName = "Jim", LastName = "Green" };

        Console.WriteLine("ContactYieldStore: Creating contact 3");
        yield return new ContactModel { FirstName = "Susan", LastName = "Orange" };
    }
}

static void Main(string[] args)
{
    var store = new ContactYieldStore();
    var contacts = store.GetEnumerator();

    Console.WriteLine("Ready to iterate through the collection.");
    Console.ReadLine();
}

Console Output 
Ready to iterate through the collection.
Note: The collection wasn't executed at all. This is due to the "deferred execution" nature of IEnumerable. Constructing an item will only occur when it is really required.
Let's call the collection again and obverse the behaviour when we fetch the first contact in the collection.
```

```
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    var store = new ContactYieldStore();
    var contacts = store.GetEnumerator();

    Console.WriteLine("Ready to iterate through the collection");
    Console.WriteLine("Hello {0}", contacts.First().FirstName);
    Console.ReadLine();
}

Console Output 
Ready to iterate through the collection 
ContactYieldStore: Creating contact 1 
Hello Bob

Nice! Only the first contact was constructed when the client "pulled" the item out of the collection.
```

#### Explicit Interface #### 
Implementing multiple interfaces can sometimes result in a collision between member signatures.

````
interface I1 { void Foo(); }
interface I2 { int Foo(); }

public class Widget : I1, I2
{
   public void Foo()
   {
      Console.WriteLine ("Widget's implementation of I1.Foo");
   }

   int I2.Foo()
   {
      Console.WriteLine ("Widget's implementation of I2.Foo");
      return 42;
   }
}

Widget w = new Widget();
w.Foo(); // Widget's implementation of I1.Foo
((I1)w).Foo(); // Widget's implementation of I1.Foo
((I2)w).Foo(); // Widget's implementation of I2.Foo

#### What is delegates and usages? ####
A delegate can be seen as a placeholder for a/some method(s). By defining a delegate, you are saying to the user of your class, "Please feel free to **assign, any method that matches this signature**, to the delegate and it will be called each time my delegate is called"

#### What is multicast delegate? #### 
* Also called as combined delegate, multiple delegate objects can be assigned to one delegate instance by using the + operator (same type in return or argument). 
* The multicast delegate contains a list of the assigned delegates. When the multicast delegate is called, it invokes the delegates in the list, in order. 
* The - operator can be used to remove a component delegate from a multicast delegate.

#### What are the differences between delegates and events? ####
An Event declaration **adds a layer of abstraction and protection on the delegate instance**. This protection **prevents clients of the delegate from resetting the delegate and its invocation list** and only allows adding or removing targets from the invocation list.

* You aren't using a public property but a public field (using events, the compiler protects your fields from unwanted access)
* Events can't be assigned directly. In this case, it won't give rise to the previous error that I have showed with overriding the behavior.
* No one outside of your class can raise the event.
* Events can be included in an interface declaration, whereas a field cannot

```
//Example with Delegates (in this case, an Action - that is a kind of delegate that doesn't return a value)
public class Animal
{
    public Action Run {get; set;}

    public void RaiseEvent()
    {
        if (Run != null)
        {
            Run();
        }
    }
}

//To use the delegate, you should do something like this:
Animal animal= new Animal();
animal.Run += () => Console.WriteLine("I'm running");
animal.Run += () => Console.WriteLine("I'm still running") ;
animal.RaiseEvent();

//This code works well but you could have some weak spots.
//For example, if I write this:
animal.Run += () => Console.WriteLine("I'm running");
animal.Run += () => Console.WriteLine("I'm still running");
animal.Run = () => Console.WriteLine("I'm sleeping") ;

//with the last line of code, I have overridden the previous behaviors just with one missing + (I have used = instead of +=). 
//Another weak spot is that every class which uses your Animal class can raise RaiseEvent just calling it animal.RaiseEvent(). 

//To avoid these weak spots you can use events in c#. Your Animal class will change in this way:
public class ArgsSpecial : EventArgs
{
    public ArgsSpecial (string val)
    {
        Operation=val;
    }

    public string Operation {get; set;}
} 

public class Animal
{
    // Empty delegate. In this way you are sure that value is always != null 
    // because no one outside of the class can change it.
    public event EventHandler<ArgsSpecial> Run = delegate{} 

    public void RaiseEvent()
    {  
         Run(this, new ArgsSpecial("Run faster"));
    }
}

//to call events
Animal animal= new Animal();
animal.Run += (sender, e) => Console.WriteLine("I'm running. My value is {0}", e.Operation);
animal.RaiseEvent();
```

#### What is the difference between delegate and action / func? ####
**Simplifies** this code by instantiating the Action<T> delegate **instead of explicitly defining a new delegate** and assigning a named method to it.

#### What is sealed class? ####
Restrict the inheritance feature, once a class is defined as a sealed class, the class cannot be inherited.

#### What are partial classes? ####
* Create a class definition in multiple files but it will be compiled as one class at run time.
* Doesn’t allowed to create a partial class in different namespace.

#### What is Serialization? #####
* Is the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes in order to store the object or transmit it to memory, a database, or a file.
* Its main purpose is to save the state of an object in order to be able to recreate it when needed.

#### What is Multithreading? ####
Enables your application to have more than one execution path at the same time.

#### What is the difference between string and String? ####
Both of them are compiled to System.String in IL (Intermediate Language), so there is no difference.

#### Garbage Collector ####
* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/garbage-collection/
* Manages the allocation and release of memory for your application. 

The heap is organized into generations so it can handle short & long lived objects.
<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>Generation</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>0</td>
            <td>Contains short-lived objects (temporary variable) and Garbage collection occurs most frequently in this generation.</td> 
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>Contains short-lived objects and serves as buffer between short-lived and long lived objects.</td>     
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>Contains long-lived objects (static data) that is live for the duration of the process.</td>     
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

#### Survival and Promotions ####
Objects that are not reclaimed in a garbage collection are known as survivors and are promoted to the next generation. 

Objects that survive a generation 0 garbage collection are promoted to generation 1; objects that survive a generation 1 garbage collection are promoted to generation 2; and objects that survive a generation 2 garbage collection remain in generation 2.

When the garbage collector detects that the survival rate is high in a generation, it increases the threshold of allocations for that generation, so the next collection gets a substantial size of reclaimed memory. The CLR continually balances two priorities: not letting an application's working set get too big and not letting the garbage collection take too much time.

#### Conditions for a Garbage Collection ####
* The system has low physical memory.
* The memory that is used by allocated objects on the managed heap surpasses an acceptable threshold. This threshold is continuously adjusted as the process runs.
* The System.GC.Collect method is called.

#### GC.Collect() ####

    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th></th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>GC.Collect()</td>

        <tr>
            <td>GC.Collect(1)</td>
            <td>Used to collect objects present in generations 0 and 1.</td>     
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

#### Drawbacks of GC.Collect() ####
* It suspends all currently executing threads. (Freezes the main and any child threads it created).
* The GC.Collect() on one application will cause a performance hit on all application in the same IIS pool.
* Expensive operation, it searches and determines whether the memory reference is pointing by any objects.

#### Weak Reference ####
Represents a weak reference, which references an object while still allowing that object to be reclaimed by garbage collection. Example usages:
* Caching (Large object)
* Event handler

#### Short vs Long Weak Reference ####
<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>Short Weak Reference</th>
            <th>Long Weak Reference</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>The target of a short weak reference becomes null when the object is reclaimed by garbage collection.</td>
            <td>A long weak reference is retained after the object's Finalize method has been called. This allows the object to be recreated, but the state of the object remains unpredictable.</td> 
        </tr>
    </tbody>

#### What is Memory-Mapped Files? ####
* Efficient random access (direct access) to file data.
* Share memory between different processes on the same computer.

#### Memory-Mapped Files and Random File I/O ####
* FileStreams are ~10 times faster than memory-mapped files for sequential I/O.
* Memory-mapped files are ~10 times faster than FileStreams for random I/O.

#### What is Interlocked? ####
* Provides atomic operations for variables that are shared by multiple threads.
* Atomic operations are a way to achive thread safety either by using some kind of locks like Mutexes or Semaphores which use atomic operations internally or by implementing lock free synchronization using atomics and memory fences.
* An operation is atomic if it is indivisible - in other words, nothing else can happen in the middle. So, with an atomic write, you can't have another thread reading the value half way through the write, and ending up "seeing" half of the old value and half of the new value. 
* Similarly, with an atomic read, you can't have another thread changing the value half way through the read, ending up (again) with a value which is neither the old value nor the new value.
* It depends on the underlying CPU architecture. For some CPUs, it's easy: The x86, for example, has direct support for many interlocked operations by means of the LOCK prefix in machine language.

#### What is Lock? ####
It restricts the critical region so that only one thread can enter a critical region at a time.

#### Interlocked vs Lock ####

#### What is Semaphore? ####
Limits the number of threads that can access a resource or pool of resources concurrently.

```
private static readonly Semaphore semaphore = new Semaphore(5, 5);

static void Main(string[] args)
{
    Task.Run(async () =>
    {
        for (var i = 1; i <= 15; ++i)
        {
            PrintSomething(i);

            if (i % 5 == 0)
            {
                await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2));
            }
        }
    });

    Console.ReadLine();
}

{
    semaphore.WaitOne();
    Console.WriteLine(number);
    semaphore.Release();
}
